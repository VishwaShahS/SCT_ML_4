# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project is developed to classify different hand gestures from image data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## 🚀 Dataset
Dataset used: [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)

- Infrared hand images
- 10 different gesture classes
- 10 subjects
- 20,000+ images

## 🧠 Model
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify gestures.

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebook for training & testing
- `src/model.py`: Python script with model code
- `dataset/`: Place extracted dataset here
